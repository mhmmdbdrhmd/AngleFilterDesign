# Instructions for Codex Agents

- Read `README.md` for project details and usage notes.
- After modifying any code, ensure Python **3.12** is available,
  install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`,
  and run `python filter_analysis.py`.
- You may modify the CI workflow to automatically commit the contents
  of `results/` (PNG plots and `performance.csv`) after each run.
- Do **not** manually commit these result files yourselfâ€”
  let the workflow handle them.
- When modifying `README.md` or `DE_README.md`, also update the other
  README and make sure `filter_analysis.py` continues updating the results
  sections in both files.
