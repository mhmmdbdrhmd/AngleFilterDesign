# Instructions for Codex Agents

- Read `README.md` for project details and usage notes.
- After modifying any code, ensure Python **3.12** is available, install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and run `python filter_analysis.py`. The script processes all CSVs in `recordings/` and saves figures in `results/`.
- Do **not** add PNG files from `results/` to version control (they are ignored).
